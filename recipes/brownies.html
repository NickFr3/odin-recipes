            Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade brownies:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make the brownies: Melt the butter on the stove, then remove from heat and add the remaining wet ingredients. 
                    Beat in the dry ingredients. Spread the batter in the pan and bake.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Frost the brownies: Stir the frosting ingredients together until well-combined, 
                    then frost the brownies while they are still warm. Cut into squares when cool.
                </li>
            </ol>

                Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 25 to 30 minutes.
