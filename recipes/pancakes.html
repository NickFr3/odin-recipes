        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These delicious breakfast cakes are said to resemble those from a famous pancake house. 
            When replacing milk for buttermilk, increase lemon juice to 1 1/2 tablespoons. Serve topped with butter.

                <li>1 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
                <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 dash salt</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter, or as needed</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla in a bowl; stir in sugar. 
                Whisk in flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, combining the batter with just a few strokes to moisten. 
                Leave the lumps.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk egg and lemon juice together in a separate bowl; gently stir into the batter. 
                Refrigerate the batter for at least 30 minutes, up to 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium heat and grease with the butter. 
                Pour 1/3 cup of batter per pancake into the skillet and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip with spatula and brown the other side, about 2 more minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
